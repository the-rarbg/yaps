      'YAPS (Yet another piracy site) is a torrent site that allows users to download and share copyrighted content such as movies, music, software, and more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does YAPS work?',

  },
  {
    question: 'How can I protect my privacy while using YAPS?',

  },
  {
    question: "What if I can't find the content I'm looking for on YAPS?",
    answer:

    question: 'Is it safe to download from Yaps?',
    answer:
      "We allow only verified torrents to be uploaded on our site.Yet there are no absolutes when it comes to protection .User should always scan/test whatever they download and don't take anything for granted. Mistakes often happen as the uploaders are also humans, or someone could just simply want to trick us. From our side, as a site, we try our best to keep you protected but that does NOT mean you should let your guards down.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there any rule to maintain  the ratio ?',

  },
  {
    question: 'What is Hit and Run ?',
    answer:
      'Hit and Run is a term used to describe a user who downloads a torrent and then does not seed it back for other users to download. This is considered bad etiquette and is frowned upon by the community.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between a seed and a leech?',
    answer:
      ' A "Seed" is a user who has a complete copy of the file being shared and is actively sharing it with others while "Leech" is a user who is downloading the file but is not sharing it with others.}',
